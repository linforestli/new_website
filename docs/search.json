    "text": "Welcome! I am a student at the faculty of information at the University of Toronto. This website records my projects relating to data science.\nWhen I’m not hitting the books, you can find me doing a bunch of things I enjoy. I’m a huge movie buff and enjoy getting lost in different stories and perspectives. I’m also a big fan of bubble tea and love trying out new flavours and combinations. Photography is another hobby of mine, capturing memories and moments that are worth cherishing forever. I also love video games - Nintendo rules the ______ world.\nI love watching stand-up comedies. Laughing and having a good time with friends and family are important to me. Reading is also something I love doing in my spare time. I’m currently engrossed in the book After the Quake by Haruki Murakami. I believe that literature has the power to help us understand the world around us better.\nBeing from Wuhan and studying in Toronto, I’ve had the opportunity to experience different cultures and meet people from diverse backgrounds. This has helped me to become more open-minded and adaptable in different situations.\nThanks for checking out my website! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss."
